## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Agriapp</h3>
<ul><li>Agriapp is a multilingual, AI-powered mobile application designed to provide small and marginal farmers with personalized, real-time crop advisory. The app leverages advanced machine learning models to analyze soil data, weather conditions, crop history, and market trends. Farmers can input their land details, upload images for pest/disease detection, and receive instant recommendations in their native language. The solution integrates weather APIs, soil health databases, and market price feeds to deliver actionable insights. Voice support and a simple interface ensure accessibility for users with low digital literacy. The app also collects feedback and usage data to continuously improve its advisory services, making it a comprehensive, user-friendly tool for sustainable and profitable farming.<b></b> </li>
<li><b>Agriapp directly tackles the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers by providing tailored, data-driven recommendations that consider local soil, weather, and crop conditions. The app breaks language and literacy barriers through multilingual support and voice features, ensuring accessibility for all users.
* By offering real-time pest and disease detection, weather alerts, and market price updates, Agriapp empowers farmers to make informed decisions, reduce input costs, and improve yields. The platform’s user-friendly design and continuous feedback loop further ensure that advisory services remain relevant, effective, and easy to use for the target audience</b></li>
<li><b>Innovation and uniqueness of the solution:</b> Agriapp stands out by combining AI-driven, hyper-local advisory with multilingual and voice-enabled support, making advanced agri-tech accessible to even the most underserved farmers. Unlike generic advisory tools, Agriapp integrates real-time data from multiple sources (weather, soil, market) and uses image-based pest/disease detection powered by machine learning.
* Its feedback-driven improvement loop, offline functionality, and intuitive design ensure continuous relevance and usability. This holistic, inclusive approach bridges the digital divide and sets Agriapp apart as a truly transformative solution for Indian agriculture.</li></ul>

## Technical Approach
<h3>TECHNICAL APPORACH</h3>
</li><li><b>Technologies to be used:</b> 
• <b>Mobile App Development:</b> Flutter (Dart) for cross-platform Android/iOS support
• <b>Backend/API:</b> Node.js with Express or Python (FastAPI/Django REST) for scalable APIs
• <b>AI/ML:</b> Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) for crop advisory, pest/disease detection, and recommendation models
• <b>Database:</b> PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user data, soil/market/weather records
• <b>Cloud & Hosting:</b> AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for backend, storage, and ML model deployment
• <b>APIs:</b> Integration with weather APIs, government agri-data, and market price feeds
• <b>Voice & Language:</b> Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and translation APIs for multilingual and voice support
• <b>Image Processing:</b> OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite for on-device pest/disease detection
• <b>Security:</b> OAuth2, JWT for authentication and data privacy
• <b>Other:</b> Firebase for push notifications and analytics

</li>
<li><b>Methodology and process for implementation:</b>
1. <b>Requirement Analysis:</b> Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders (farmers, agri-experts, government bodies).
2. <b>System Design:</b> Design system architecture, data flow, and user interface (UI/UX) wireframes. Prepare flow charts for advisory logic and user journeys.
3. <b>Data Collection & Integration:</b> Aggregate soil, weather, crop, and market data from public APIs and government sources. Prepare datasets for AI/ML model training.
4. <b>AI/ML Model Development:</b> Build and train models for crop recommendation, pest/disease detection (using image data), and yield prediction.
5. <b>Backend & API Development:</b> Develop secure, scalable REST APIs for data processing, user management, and advisory delivery.
6. <b>Mobile App Development:</b> Implement the cross-platform app using Flutter, integrating APIs, voice, and multilingual support.
7. <b>Testing & Validation:</b> Conduct unit, integration, and user acceptance testing. Validate AI/ML outputs with agri-experts.
8. <b>Pilot Deployment:</b> Launch a pilot with a small group of farmers, collect feedback, and refine features.
9. <b>Full-Scale Deployment:</b> Roll out the app to a wider audience, monitor usage, and provide support.
10. <b>Continuous Improvement:</b> Use analytics and user feedback to update models, add features, and enhance usability.

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>FEASIBILITY AND VIADILITY</h3>
<ul><li><b>Analysis of the feasibility of the idea:</b> The Agriapp solution is highly feasible due to the increasing penetration of smartphones and mobile internet in rural India. The required technologies—AI/ML, cloud computing, and mobile development—are mature and accessible. 
*Publicly available datasets and APIs for weather, soil, and market prices support rapid development. Collaboration with agricultural experts and local organizations can ensure data accuracy and user adoption. The modular architecture allows for phased implementation and scaling. Initial pilot programs can validate the approach before full-scale rollout. With government and NGO support, the solution can be deployed cost-effectively and maintained sustainably.</li>
<li><b>Potential challenges and risks:</b>
